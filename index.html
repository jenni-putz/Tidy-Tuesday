   <h1>Tidy Tuesday Code</h1>
   <p>Each week, Thomas Mock posts a dataset for R users to play around with. The goal is to wrangle with the data and visualize it.
   The official Tidy Tuesday repo can be found here: <a href = "https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday"> </a>.</p>
   <br>
   <p>I will be updating this page as I complete the Tidy Tuesday projects each week. Feel free to view my work on them below!</p>
